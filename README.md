*Title*: Fundamentals of Git and Github

*Abstract*: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase and collaborate with other developers. Github is a web-based platform that provides a centralized location for storing and managing Git repositories. This lecture will cover the basics of Git, including how to create a repository, make commits, and push changes to a remote repository. We will also cover how to use Github to collaborate with other developers and manage issues and pull requests. Examples and code snippets will be presented in Python.

*Materials*:  

- slides: `hi_git.qmd`
- `R_materials/` : if you like R flavor, there are past lectures that I taught that covers this material in more detail

*About your speaker*:

Just a real, down-to-Mars girl, living in a material world, who took a midnight train going anywhere. Boring things: doctoral student at Drexel University in computational social sciences and NLP, Google WomenTechmakers ambassador, Social Justice in Data Science Bookclub Organizer, and #IamRemarkable Facilitator. Not so boring: cat-mom and wannabe wine connoisseur.
