Interacting With `git` With GitHub and RStudio

# What does this look like?

+ Make a new project with RStudio in a New Directory with a git repository:

.center[![](images/gitProject.png)]

---

At this point, this step should be familiar. But what if you wanted to bring in an *existing* repository from GitHub?

Checking the .red[History] of a branch is important because it enables you to display a list of all of the commits on your current branch. ðŸ˜ˆ

# GitKracken

I use GitKraken (mostly when I work in SAS).

Hey! Here's that repo I made! I can see the commits I made on my main "master" branch.

Git Clients other than Rstudio can be really usefull too.

RULES/HOUSEKEEPING ðŸ§¹

# Remove Sensitive Files

+ Set your .gitignore to block all data files.
I keep a gist here:
.center[https://gist.github.com/RaymondBalise/300d99c2b6450feda3ed5a816f396191]

+ Never put files with sensitive data on GitHub (or other online services).  
+ Do NOT put sensitive data in a private repo on GitHub  (or other online services).
+ If you accidentally put protected health information on a machine that is not maintained by your company/university/entity contact the data privacy officer at your organization immediately.
+ Removing files from a repository is not casual:

## Commits

* Commit related changes
  * .li-sub[A commit should be a wrapper for related changes. For example, fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits.]
  
* Don't commit half-done work

* Commit often
  * .li-sub[This allows you to share your code more frequently with others that way itâ€™s easier for everyone to integrate changes regularly and avoid having .red[merge conflicts].]

* Test before you commit
  * .li-sub[Test your changes thoroughly to make sure it really is completed and has no side effects]
  
* Write good commit messages

* Git is NOT a Backup System!
  * .li-sub[You should not use git like it was a backup system. When doing version control, you should pay attention to committing semantically (related changes) â€“ you shouldnâ€™t just cram in files.]
---

## Always create a new branch

This is your mantra: *new feature = new branch*

When you are ready to merge your changes into `main`, create a .red[pull request] and request someone do a review your code and leave feedback

![](images/code_review.png)

---

## Trim your tree ðŸŒ³

Once you're merged your changes, it's a good practice to delete your branch. The only branches that should be on your repository are branches that are actively being developed on.
